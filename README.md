# stage_ros
Package which contains ROS specific hooks and tools for the Stage simulator.

Updated the code to solve the issue [#69](https://github.com/ros-simulation/stage_ros/issues/69)

TF name starts with '/' error for multi laser and multi robot cases

Just download and compile this version instead of the repository version

This has been tested on ROS-Melodic
